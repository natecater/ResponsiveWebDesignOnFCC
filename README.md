# ResponsiveWebDesignOnFCC

This repository holds all of the code/work I did for the Responsive Web Design on the freeCodeCamp platform

Because I'm doing quite a bit of learning/coding on platforms such as CodeCademy and freeCodeCamp, a lot of the code that is outputted remains on those platforms

And while I'm aware this code output was guided from start to finish, I still think the time/effort deserves to be noticed by anyone observing my github...

If I'm spending time learning in those platforms, then that should be documented and displayed since it's taking away from other learning platforms
such as Udemy, Edx, Odin that would be encouraging more coding/work done in a local environment
